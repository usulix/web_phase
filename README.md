# Webpack - Phaser - Chromecast starter project

Initially just a trimmed down version of https://github.com/drhayes/sneaker

I will - ideally - be adding connectors to receive input from a mobile device and Chromecast specific code.

Initial commit should be a good webpack - phaser desktop starter setup.
