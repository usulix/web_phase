# Webpack - Phaser - Chromecast starter project
## *first Phaser game branch* 

Initially just a trimmed down version of https://github.com/drhayes/sneaker

I will - ideally - be adding connectors to receive input from a mobile device and Chromecast specific code.

Initial commit should be a good webpack - phaser desktop starter setup.

This branch is a refactoring of the http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game to work with the webpack and other structure / modular / architecture changes of this Phaser coding flavor's style.
